### Key Components
1. **Data Pipeline**
   - Automated API ingestion
   - Duration normalization
   - Response accuracy mapping

2. **Core Analysis**
   ```python
   def analyze_performance():
       # Topic-level aggregation
       # Difficulty pattern detection
       # Time/accuracy correlation
   ```

3. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Weakness prioritization
   - Adaptive learning strategies
   - Gemini-generated study plans
